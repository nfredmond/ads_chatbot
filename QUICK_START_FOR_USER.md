# üöÄ Quick Start Guide - Connect Your Ad Platforms

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

Your application now has **production-ready OAuth 2.0 authentication** for all three advertising platforms:

- ‚úÖ Google Ads API (v21)
- ‚úÖ Meta Ads API (v21.0)  
- ‚úÖ LinkedIn Ads API (202505)

**Most importantly**: All dummy/sample data has been removed. The app will ONLY show your real campaign data.

   - Google Ads
   - Meta Ads
   - LinkedIn Ads

### Option 2: Full Production Setup

Follow the comprehensive guide in `OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md` to:
1. Create developer accounts on each platform
2. Get OAuth credentials
3. Configure redirect URIs
4. Complete API approval processes

## üîë What You Need for Each Platform

### Google Ads

You need 4 things:
1. **OAuth Client ID** - Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. **OAuth Client Secret** - Get from Google Cloud Console
3. **Developer Token** - Get from [Google Ads API Center](https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter)
4. **Customer ID** - Find in your Google Ads account (top-right corner, format: 123-456-7890)

**Important**: You need a Google Ads **Manager Account (MCC)** to get a developer token. Standard accounts won't work.

### Meta Ads (Facebook/Instagram)

You need 2 things:
1. **App ID** - Get from [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps)
2. **App Secret** - Get from Meta for Developers

**Note**: You'll need to request "Advanced Access" for Marketing API (takes 1-2 weeks).

### LinkedIn Ads

You need 2 things:
1. **Client ID** - Get from [LinkedIn Developers](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps)
2. **Client Secret** - Get from LinkedIn Developers

**Note**: You need "Marketing Developer Platform" access approved (can take weeks to months).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### API Approval Timeline

**Be patient - approvals take time:**

- **Google Ads**: 
  - Initial: Test Access (immediate, test accounts only)
  - Basic Access: 1-2 weeks (15,000 operations/day)
  - Standard Access: 2-4 weeks (unlimited operations)
  
- **Meta Ads**:
  - Development Mode: Immediate (limited testing)
  - Advanced Access: 1-2 weeks after app review
  - Required: Privacy Policy URL, Terms of Service, Business verification
  
- **LinkedIn Ads**:
  - Marketing Developer Platform: **Weeks to months**
  - Longest approval process of all three platforms
  - Requires company page association and detailed use case

### Data Freshness & Limitations

**Important to know:**

- **Google Ads**: Data updates every few hours, no real-time webhooks
- **Meta Ads**: Near real-time data, webhooks available for leads/conversions
- **LinkedIn Ads**: **24-hour delay** on analytics data (yesterday's data available today)

### Rate Limits Built-In

The app automatically handles rate limiting:

- **Google Ads**: Max 15,000 operations/day (Basic Access), 5 queries/second
- **Meta Ads**: Dynamic throttling (pauses when reaching 80% limit)
- **LinkedIn Ads**: Application-level daily limits, ~3 queries/second

You don't need to worry about these - the system manages them automatically!

### Redirect URIs Must Match

When setting up OAuth apps, make sure redirect URIs **exactly** match:

**For Development** (localhost):
```
Google: http://localhost:3000/auth/google
Meta: http://localhost:3000/auth/meta
LinkedIn: http://localhost:3000/auth/linkedin
```

**For Production** (your domain):
```
Google: https://yourdomain.com/auth/google
Meta: https://yourdomain.com/auth/meta
LinkedIn: https://yourdomain.com/auth/linkedin
```

### Token Expiration & Auto-Refresh

- **Google Ads**: Refresh tokens **never expire**! ‚úÖ
  - Access tokens refresh automatically every hour
  - No reconnection needed once set up
  - System uses refresh token to get new access tokens
  
- **Meta Ads**: Long-lived tokens last **60 days**
  - You'll receive email warning 7 days before expiration
  - Must reconnect manually via OAuth
  - System automatically converts short-lived to long-lived tokens
  
- **LinkedIn Ads**: Access tokens last **60 days**
  - You'll receive email warning 7 days before expiration
  - Must reconnect manually via OAuth
  - No automatic refresh available from LinkedIn

### No Dummy Data Anymore

The app used to fall back to dummy/sample data when API calls failed. **This has been completely removed**. Now you'll either see:
- ‚úÖ Your real campaign data, OR
- ‚ùå A clear error message explaining what went wrong

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No refresh token received" (Google Ads)

**Why this happens**: Google only issues refresh tokens on the first authorization with `prompt=consent`. If you've authorized before, Google assumes you already have the refresh token.

**Fix**: 
1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
2. Find your app and click "Remove Access"
3. Try connecting again - you'll get a new refresh token

### "No ad accounts found" (Meta or LinkedIn)

**Why this happens**: The account you're signing in with doesn't have access to any ad accounts.

**Fix**: 
- **Meta**: Make sure you're using an account connected to Facebook Business Manager with ad accounts
- **LinkedIn**: Ensure your LinkedIn account has Campaign Manager access
- Personal accounts without business access won't work

### "Invalid redirect URI"

**Why this happens**: The redirect URI in your OAuth app doesn't match what the app is using.

**Fix**: 
1. Check OAuth app settings on the platform
2. Ensure redirect URI matches **exactly**:
   - Protocol: `http://` vs `https://`
   - Domain: `localhost:3000` vs `yourdomain.com`
   - Path: `/auth/google` (no trailing slash)

### "Failed to sync data"

**Common causes**:
1. **Token expired** - Reconnect the account
2. **API approval pending** - Check developer console
3. **No campaigns exist** - Create campaigns on the platform first
4. **Rate limit reached** - Wait and try again (system auto-retries)
5. **API credentials invalid** - Recheck Client ID, Secret, Developer Token

**Fix**: 
1. Check the specific error message
2. View logs in Settings ‚Üí Connected Accounts
3. Verify credentials are correct
4. Ensure campaigns exist on the platform
5. Check platform's developer console for API status

### "Rate limit exceeded"

**What it means**: You've hit the platform's API quota

**What happens**:
- System automatically retries with exponential backoff
- Pauses requests to avoid further rate limiting
- Logs the event for monitoring

**You should**:
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Check if you need to upgrade API access tier
- Reduce frequency of manual sync requests

### Email notifications not working

**This is optional** - the app works fine without email configured.

**To enable**:
1. Add email settings to environment variables
2. For Gmail: Use App-Specific Password (not regular password)
3. Test by triggering a manual sync error

### "Webhook verification failed" (Meta)

**Only relevant if you're using webhooks for lead ads**

**Fix**:
1. Verify `META_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` in .env matches Meta app settings
2. Ensure webhook URL uses HTTPS in production
3. Use ngrok for local testing: `ngrok http 3000`
4. Check Meta's webhook testing tool shows green checkmark
